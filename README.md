## Get started

to get started, at first you'll need some packages, the basics are the following:

- **bspwm** *(Window manager)*
- **sxhkd** *(Shortcuts manager)*
- **polybar** *(Status bar)*
- **dmenu** *(App finder manager)*
- **dunst** *(Status manager)*
- **nitrogen** *(To set wallpapers)*
- **thunar** *(Directory manager not necessary)*

once you install those packages you have to make the config directories:

- **~/.config/polybar**
